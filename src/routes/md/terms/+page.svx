The following Terms of Service (“TOS”) govern your use of the `MC Linker`. The terms "we", "us", and "our" refer to the
owner and moderators of the `MC Linker`. The terms "Bot" and "MC Linker" refer to the Discord bot itself.
MC Linker may also offer services or features that have their own terms of use or rules, and to the extent any
portion of those special terms conflict with these TOS, the special terms will govern for that specific portion.
Using MC Linker is at-will and can be terminated at any time by either us or you for any reason. By using the Bot,
you agree to be bound by these TOS. If you do not agree to be bound, you are not authorized to use the Bot. These TOS
are a legal contract between you and the Bot and govern your access to and use of the Bot. We reserve the right to
modify these TOS at any time without prior notice. You should visit this Site from time to time to review the current
TOS. By using the Bot subsequent to any modification of these TOS, you agree to be bound by such modification(s).
MC Linker is not affiliated with Minecraft, Mojang or any game developers of Minecraft.
